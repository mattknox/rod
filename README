* FIX (url)

== DESCRIPTION:
This is intended to be a simpler replacement for piston.  It grabs source from a remote repository and dumps it in the specified location, and creates a file for its own use that notes what version was pulled.  
git-archive --format=tar --remote=git://gitorious.org/klisp-scripting-engine/mainline.git this is about the functionality I wanted.


should make a .directory, with a file that has the version it checked out, and then a checkout directory inside that that gets exported out to the enclosing dir.  


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

I estimate that I can do this in about 300-500 lines of code, which should be doable in a day or two.  

The commandset should be:

rod install url [dir]  # install whatever is at url into either . or dir
rod update  path  [revision] # update path to head or revision
rod diff path [revision]
# there is no rod remove, because it doesn't interact with VCS.  It just lets you kill it.
