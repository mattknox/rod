This is intended to be a simpler replacement for piston.  It grabs source from a remote repository and dumps it in the specified location, and creates a file for its own use that notes what version was pulled.  

I estimate that I can do this in about 300-500 lines of code, which should be doable in a day or two.  

The commandset should be:

rod install url [dir]  # install whatever is at url into either . or dir
rod update  path  [revision] # update path to head or revision
rod diff path [revision]
# there is no rod remove path, because it doesn't interact with VCS.  It just lets you kill it.
